# Evolutionary timetable scheduling

## Abstract

This project covers methods used for solving the timetable scheduling problem specific for timetable formats in the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. The algorithms described represent a hybrid approach combining a 1+1 evolutionary strategy with shotgun hill-climbing. Apart from these, methods that were and taken into account and tested are simulated annealing and a classical genetic algorithm. However, the last two techniques have not yielded results as good as the forementioned ones.
